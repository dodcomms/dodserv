# DIY or DIE Server

###### Private collaboration, communication and information sharing infrastructure for groups engaged in political activism

## The DIY or DIE Server is:

* a alternative to cloud hosted services
* a collection of free and open source operating systems, chat servers, forums, web sites and wikis
* completely self-hosted (on a normal computer, USB stick or SD card) behind Tor hidden services [1](https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en "Hidden Service Protocol")
* resistant to surveillance and censorship
* easy to install and maintain

## The DIY or DIE Server allows:

* activists to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy or security
* activists to communicate with each other without any third party being wise to their activity or even the knowledge that they are communicating with each other

# DIY or DIE Server

#### Private collaboration, communication and information sharing infrastructure for groups engaged in political activism

## The DIY or DIE Server is:

* a alternative to cloud hosted services
* a collection of free and open source operating systems, chat servers, forums, web sites and wikis
* completely self-hosted (on a normal computer, USB stick or SD card) behind Tor hidden services [1]
* resistant to surveillance and censorship
* easy to install and maintain

## The DIY or DIE Server allows:

* activists to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy or security
* activists to communicate with each other without any third party being wise to their activity or even the the knowledge that they are communicating with each other
